# web-calendar

#### Development process
- when the developer is starting to work on a task he/she should put label _in progress_ on it
- each task should be implemented in a separate branch created from **dev**
- after the task is completed PR should be created into **dev** branch and link with it should be posted in a chat
- PR should be linked to an issue, this way it will close an issue when it is completed
- it is recommended for every team member to take part in code review
- each commit message must start with the issue number it is related to. Example: #6 fixed displaying calendar grid

Sensitive data (accounts, passwords, connection strings, etc.) should not be committed. Every developer will use its own configuration file(s).
